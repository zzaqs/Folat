# Folat v0.2.0
Folat is an imperative esolang and a Finite State Machine (FSM), partially inspired by Assembly.
This esolang uses fixed-width parsing, where the instruction and the two arguments must be exactly 3 characters long with one character between them. Folat was created on December 7, 2025, by the user @ytebbit.

# Memory
MEM (Memory) is the main memory and is a 50-byte array. PNR (PoiNt Record) is a long that stores the index of the last line that starts with "---". FLG (FLaG) is a boolean that acts as a flag, and the instructions `cmp`, `gpt`, and `gpf` use FLG.

# Syntax
Folat uses a fixed-width parsing model following the `ist trg dat` format. The ist field consists of a 3-character instruction, while the trg field (target) must be a 3-digit number from 000 to 049 (padded with leading zeros). The dat field contains the data. Since empty fields are not permitted, any unused fields must be filled with placeholder text or spaces to avoid the `error: line too short` error or the `error: line too long` error. For documentation, start a line with ; for full-line comments. Inline comments are allowed without a semicolon, provided the total line length is either under 11 or over 150 characters; this prevents the C implementation's fgets function from misinterpreting empty fields.

# Instructions
## Arithmetic
- `add trg dat`: adds dat to the trg index byte in memory.

- `sub trg dat`: subtracts dat from the trg index byte in memory.

## Points
**What are 'points'?**
In Folat, points are lines that begin with "---". When the interpreter processes this line, it notes the line number in the PNR, and you can make the interpreter return to this line with the `gpt` and `gpf` instructions.

- `gpt`: returns to the line that PNR points to if FLG = true.

- `gpf`: return to the line that PNR points to if FLG = false.

## Utilities
- `cmp trg dat`: if MEM[trg] == dat, FLG = true; otherwise, FLG = false. The data field only accepts characters such as ASCII codes.

- `set trg dat`: writes dat to MEM starting from the trg index, and converts "\" to 0x0A and "-" to 0x07 (pseudo-null), which becomes 0x00 in MEM.

- `out trg`: simply prints MEM[trg].

- `ext trg`: if trg is 001, the program displays the MEM and terminates; otherwise, the program simply terminates.

# How to use
First, clone the repository and use the "make":
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ytebbit/Folat
$ cd Folat
$ make
```

Optionally, add the CLI:
```
$ make addcli
```

To add the binary to the PATH, you can use `make addcli`. Then, you can run the example:
```bash
$ fol ~/Folat/src/examples/ex2.fol
Hello World!
```

# Examples
## Printing a byte
```
; line comment
set 000 A-- inline comment
out 000    ;
```

## "Hello World!"
```folat
set 000 Hel  MEM[0], MEM[1], MEM[2] = 'H', 'e', 'l'
set 003 lo ;
set 006 Wor
set 009 ld!
set 012 \--  'set' replace '\' to '\n', and remove '-'
ext 001    ;
```

## Simulating condition
```
set 000 0tf
---        ; PNR = 2
cmp 000 050  FLG = (MEM[0] == 50)
add 000 001  MEM[0] += 1
out 002    ; print(MEM[2])
gpf        ;
out 001    ; print(MEM[1])
ext 000    ; return 0
```
